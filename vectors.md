1. Vector Addition:<br>
https://www.geogebra.org/m/wDCSJEKy <br>
Drag each of the red points around to get a sense of what changes. Three representations of vector addition are shown. <ol><li>What is the difference between the first two representations? What is the same?</li> <li>What is the relation between those two representations and the one at the bottom?</li> <li>Where do you need to place the point connecting *u* and *v* so that *u* and *v* correspond to the *x* and *y* components of the vector *u+v*?</li></ol>
2. Vector Subtraction:<br>

Notice how similar this is to the bottom representation in the vector addition applet above. Which of the vectors here corresponds to which of the vectors there? 
3. Magnitude and Components of a Vector:<br>
https://www.geogebra.org/m/CEBdRH69<br>
The components of a vector correspond to the opposite and adjacent sides of a triangle, with the vector as its hypotenuse <ol><li>How can you calculate the *x* and *y* components of a vector *v* with magnitude (length) |*v*| and angle &alpha;? Write down the formulae.</li> <li>How can you calculate the magnitude of a vector from its *x* and *y* components?</li> <li>What is the magnitude |*v*| of a vector *v* with *x* and *y* coordinates (4, 3)?</li> <li>What is the angle of that vector, relative to the horizontal, to 1 decimal place?</li> <li>What are the *x* and *y* components of a vector with angle 45&deg; and magnitude 4.24?</li></ol>
4. Transformations:<br>
