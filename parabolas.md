* Plot the graph of y=x<sup>2</sup> by typing y=2x^2 into the box on the left, where it says 'Input', and pressing Enter.
* Copy this graph into your jotter, complete with the axes, in the range -2 x 2 (that is, between the lines x=-2 and x=2) and label with the equation of the curve (y=x<sup>2</sup>).
* Repeat for y=x<sup>2</sup>, and copy onto the same set of axes in your jotter. Then do the same for y=0x<sup>2</sup>, y=-x<sup>2</sup> and y=-2x<sup>2</sup>.

* Plot the graph of y=x<sup>2</sup> again, and copy it onto a fresh set of axes.
* Can you work out what the graph of y=x<sup>2</sup>+1 will look like? Check to see if you're correct, and then copy the graph of this equation onto the same set of axes, labelling it clearly.
* Can you guess what y=(x-1)<sup>2</sup> will look like? Check your guess, and again copy the graph onto the same set of axes and label it.
* What are the coordinates of the minimum turning point of this curve? Label it on your graph.
* Where is the minimum turning point for y=(x+1)<sup>2</sup>? What about y=(x+2)<sup>2</sup>? What about y=(x+1)<sup>2</sup>+1?
* Can you see a pattern in these results?
* What are the coordinates of the minimum turning point if y=(x-u)<sup>2</sup>+v?
