1. Plot the graph of *y=2x*<sup>2</sup> by typing *y*=2*x*^2 into the box on the left, where it says 'Input', and pressing Enter.
1. Copy this graph into your jotter, complete with the axes, in the range -2 ≤ *x* ≤ 2 (that is, between the lines *x*=-2 and *x*=2) and label with the equation of the curve (*y=2x*<sup>2</sup>).
1. Repeat for *y*=*x*<sup>2</sup>, and copy onto the same set of axes in your jotter. Then do the same for *y*=0*x*<sup>2</sup>, *y*=-*x*<sup>2</sup> and *y*=-2*x*<sup>2</sup>.

1. Plot the graph of *y=x*<sup>2</sup> again, and copy it onto a fresh set of axes.
1. Can you work out what the graph of *y=x*<sup>2</sup>+1 will look like? Check to see if you're correct, and then copy the graph of this equation onto the same set of axes, labelling it clearly.
1. Can you guess what *y*=(*x*-1)<sup>2</sup> will look like? Check your guess, and again copy the graph onto the same set of axes and label it.
1. What are the coordinates of the minimum turning point of this curve? Label it on your graph.
1. Where is the minimum turning point for *y*=(*x*+1)<sup>2</sup>? What about *y*=(*x*+2)<sup>2</sup>? What about *y*=(*x*+1)<sup>2</sup>+1? And *y*=2(*x*+1)<sup>2</sup>+1
1. Can you see a pattern in these results?
1. What are the coordinates of the minimum turning point if *y*=*a*(x-u)<sup>2</sup>+*v*?
