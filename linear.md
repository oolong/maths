1.  Using the sliders, change the values of *m* and *c* so that the red line (see Figure 7.12) goes through points *A* and *B*. Write down the values in your jotter.

2.  Now consider a new equation, *y* = 2*x* + 3.  Move points *A* and *B* to two new positions *that you think will lie on this line*. Write down your guesses in your jotter.

    Next, type *y* = 2*x* + 3 into the Input box at the bottom of the screen and check if your conjecture was correct. Record whether you guessed correctly, and if not, write down two pairs of coordinates that do lie on the line.

3.  When you are ready to move on to the next example, do the same for each of the equations below. (Note: for each example, be sure to place the points *A* and *B before* typing in the equation.)

    -   *y* = *x*/2 + 1
    -   *y* = 3*x* - 5
    -   3*x* + 4*y* = 12
    -   5*x* - 2*y* = 5
    -   and so on (i.e. make up some of your own).

    You may wish to start challenging yourself by placing both of the points *A* and *B* in a different quadrant of the graph (for example, where the *x*-coordinate is negative and the *y*-coordinate is positive) or by placing the two points in quadrants different from each other.


4.  Go back to the front page of GeoGebra and create the same general family of linear graphs with the equation *y* = *mx* + *c*, along with two separate sliders for *m* and *c*.
5.  Use your completed linear graph to explore the following questions, and record your findings in your jotter. Under what conditions will your linear graph:
    -   a. be horizontal?
    -   b. be horizontal and lie below the *x*-axis?
    -   c. pass through the origin?
    -   d. pass through the origin, running from top left to bottom right?
    -   e. form an isosceles right-angled triangle with the two axes?
6.  Now try to make up some more questions like these, and explore them for yourself.
