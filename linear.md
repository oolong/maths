1.  Using the sliders, change the values of *m* and *c* so that the red line (see Figure 7.12) goes through points *A* and *B*.

2.  Now consider a new equation, *y* = 2*x* + 3.  Move points *A* and *B* to two new positions *that you think will lie on this line*.

    Next, type *y* = 2*x* + 3 into the Input box at the bottom of the screen and check if your conjecture was correct.

3.  When you are ready to move on to the next example, do the same for each of the equations below. (Note: for each example, be sure to place the points *A* and *B before* typing in the equation.)

    -   *y* = *x*/2 + 1
    -   *y* = 3*x* - 5
    -   3*x* + 4*y* = 12
    -   5*x* - 2*y* = 5
    -   and so on (i.e. make up some of your own).

    You may wish to start challenging yourself by placing both of the points *A* and *B* in a different quadrant of the graph (for example, where the *x*-coordinate is negative and the *y*-coordinate is positive) or by placing the two points in quadrants different from each other.
